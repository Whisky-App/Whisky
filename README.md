Whisky provides a clean and easy to use graphical wrapper for Wine built in native SwiftUI. You can make and manage bottles, install and run Windows apps and games, and unlock the full potential of your Mac with no technical knowledge required. Whisky is built on top of CrossOver 22.1.1, and Apple's own `Game Porting Toolkit`.

Special thanks to [Gcenx](https://github.com/Gcenx), without your amazing work Whisky wouldn't be possible.

# FAQ

### The direct download link for the toolkit doesn't work

Make sure you're logged in to the Apple Developer website. If it still won't work use an [indirect link](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=game%20porting%20toolkit).

### Do I need to follow the steps in the toolkit's README?

No, you don't, in fact you shouldn't follow them.

*Whisky doesn't exist without CrossOver. This project is not meant to outcompete it or surpass it in any way. Please continue to support the fantastic work of CodeWeavers.*
